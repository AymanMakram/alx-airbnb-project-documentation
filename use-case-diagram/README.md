# Airbnb Clone Backend (API)

## Project Objective

To build a **scalable, secure, and robust RESTful API** and server-side infrastructure for an Airbnb-style property rental marketplace. This backend manages all core logic, data persistence, and external service integrations required by the client-side application.

---

## Core Functionalities & Use Cases

The backend supports three primary user roles (Guest, Host, Admin) and external services.

### 1. User & Identity Management (Actor: Guest, Host)

| Feature | Description | Technical Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Registration & Login** | Allow users to sign up as a Guest or Host, and securely log in. | Uses **JWT** for secure session management and **OAuth** (Google/Facebook) for social login. |
| **Profile Management** | Users can update personal information and upload profile pictures. | **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) ensures correct permissions. |

### 2. Property & Listing Management (Actor: Host, Guest, Admin)

| Feature | Description | Technical Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Listing CRUD** | Hosts can **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** their property listings (including details, amenities, and availability). | **RESTful APIs** (`POST`, `GET`, `PUT/PATCH`, `DELETE`). |
| **Search & Filtering** | Guests can efficiently search by location, price, number of guests, and amenities. | Implements **Pagination** and optimized database queries for performance. |
| **Image Storage** | Handles storage of property images and user photos. | Uses external service: **AWS S3 / Cloudinary**. |

### 3. Booking & Payment System (Actor: Guest, Host, Payment Gateway)

| Feature | Description | Technical Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Booking Flow** | Guests reserve a property for specific dates. | Includes **Date Validation** logic to prevent double bookings and tracks status (**Pending**, **Confirmed**, **Canceled**, **Completed**). |
| **Payment Processing** | Handles secure upfront payments from guests and automatic payouts to hosts. | Integration with **Stripe / PayPal** and supports **Multi-Currency** transactions. |
| **Notifications** | Alerts users on booking confirmations, cancellations, and payment status. | Uses **SendGrid / Mailgun** for email notifications. |

### 4. Quality & Administration

| Feature | Description | Technical Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reviews & Ratings** | Guests leave feedback; Hosts can respond. | Reviews are **validated and linked** to completed bookings. |
| **Admin Panel** | Centralized interface for monitoring and management. | Allows Admin to **Manage Users, Listings, and Monitor Payments**. |

## Technical Requirements & Architecture

The system is built with a focus on **scalability, performance, and security**.

### Database & APIs
* **Database:** **PostgreSQL / MySQL** (Relational) for structured data integrity (Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments tables).
* **API Standard:** Primarily **RESTful APIs** (for standard CRUD operations), with an option to implement **GraphQL** for complex data fetching.

### Infrastructure & Performance
* **Scalability:** Designed with a **Modular Architecture** to enable **Horizontal Scaling** via Load Balancers.
* **Security:** Sensitive data is secured via **Encryption**. Includes firewalls and **Rate Limiting** to mitigate malicious activity.
* **Performance:** Implements a **Caching layer** using **Redis** to boost response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).

### Testing
* **Code Quality:** Robust implementation of **Unit and Integration Tests** using frameworks like **pytest** to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
